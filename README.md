## 👋 About Me

I’m a **Senior Software Engineer** with strong expertise in **Python**, **data-driven systems**, and **enterprise automation**, currently focused on **AI Engineering and Applied Machine Learning**.

I design and build **intelligent systems** such as:
- **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** platforms  
- **LLM-powered assistants** for code and knowledge automation  
- **Data pipelines** for structured and unstructured data  
- **AI-driven web applications** using Streamlit and FastAPI  

My professional background includes building **production-grade automation and business logic** for large ERP systems (not demos), which enables me to develop **AI solutions grounded in real operational constraints**.

I’m actively transitioning into **AI Engineer / Applied ML / Data Scientist roles**, with a strong focus on **practical, end-to-end AI systems**—from data ingestion to user-facing applications.
